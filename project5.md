# YouTube Clone Task

Create a YouTube clone webpage using the following HTML tags:

## Heading

- Use appropriate heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure the page.

## Paragraph

- Write a brief introduction about the YouTube clone using a paragraph tag (`<p>`).

## List

- Create an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the features of the YouTube clone.

## Table

- Design a table (`<table>`) to showcase the video details, including columns for video title, duration, and views.

## Image

- Insert an image (`<img>`) of the YouTube logo to represent the branding.

## Video

- Embed a YouTube video using the video tag (`<video>`) and provide a fallback option for browsers that don't support it.

Feel free to add any additional styling or content to make your YouTube clone more visually appealing.

Good luck!

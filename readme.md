# HTML Documentation

## Introduction
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining the elements and their relationships.

## Getting Started
To start using HTML, you need a text editor and a web browser. Here are the steps to create a basic HTML document:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code).
2. Create a new file with the `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
3. Add the HTML doctype declaration at the beginning of the file: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
4. Create the HTML document structure using the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
5. Add content to the document using various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
6. Save the file and open it in a web browser to see the rendered webpage.

## HTML Elements
HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. Here are some commonly used elements:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of different levels.
- `<p>`: Paragraph.
- `<a>`: Anchor (link) element.
- `<img>`: Image element.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.
- `<li>`: List item.
- `<div>`: Division or container element.
- `<span>`: Inline container element.
- `<table>`: Table element.
- `<form>`: Form element.
- `<video>`: Video element.
- `<input>`: Input element.

- `class`: Specifies one or more class names for an element.
- `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
- `src`: Specifies the source URL of an image or media file.
- `href`: Specifies the URL of a linked resource.
- `style`: Specifies inline CSS styles for an element.
